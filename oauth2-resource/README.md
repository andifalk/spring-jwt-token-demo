# OAuth2 resource to consume JWT tokens

## Intro
This project provides a small web application that provides a RESTful api and requires
JWT tokens to get permission to some of the RESTful api endpoints.
The JWT tokens are required to be created and signed by the JWT creator project 
(will be validated using the corresponding public key).

The following endpoints do exist
* __"/"__: This is unrestricted 
* __"/unrestricted"__: This is unrestricted
* __"/restricted"__: This is restricted (a valid JWT token is required)
   
## System requirements
This project requires a java 8 vm with Java Cryptography Extension (JCE).

## Usage

To run the web application just use the main starter class _OAuthResourceApplication_.

For testing the restricted RESTful api you need to specify a token previously generated by the 
Jwt creator project as header value

Request:
``` http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhd...
GET http://localhost:8080/restricted
```  

Then you should see a success message like 200 (ok).
